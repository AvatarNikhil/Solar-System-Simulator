## What is it?
This is a Solar System Simulator. It simulates the motion of planets in realtime using some pretty complex maths and also is able to plan **interplanatry missions** *(not yet)*

## Why am I doing it?
Am a big fan of space flight and the journey it has still to cover. **Nasa's Curiosity Rover** or **ISRO's Martian Orbital Mission** truely inspired me,of how a group of like minded people can set out to do something impossible on the face of the planet.I love reading books, especially sci fi books, one of favourite is The Martian. Andy Weir the author of **The Martian**, used a physics simulator to simulate the motion of his fictional ship (Ares V) with respect to earth and mars, so that he could write in accurate dates in his book. That was the starting point of this project. Back then, it didnt make any sense to start learning programming, but now since I had a goal to achieve, everything was different. Rest is history...

## How does it work?

That's a great question!
There are two way to build one of these sims *(simulators)*: Accurate and not so accurate. 
Well I started of with the formal, and ever since have transversed to the latter eventually. I would recommend, building a simple planetary orbit first to understand the basic of programming and polar to cartesian coordinate conversions.
Yet, below is complete breakdown of how it works.
